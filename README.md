##Detailed Project Description

Earth observation is crucial to understand patterns of sea-level rise, surface temperature, water quality, UV ray, soil moisture, landslide, wind speed and air quality. These measurements are essential to create data-backed policies for climate action.  Earth observation resources form the basis for predictive modeling, allowing communities and businesses to plan sustainably, improving their resilience to climate change. The continuous evolution of data management systems affords great opportunities to the enhancement of knowledge and advancement of Earth science research.
