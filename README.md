## Detailed Project Description

Earth observation is crucial to understand patterns of sea-level rise, surface temperature, water quality, UV ray, soil moisture, landslide, wind speed and air quality. These measurements are essential to create data-backed policies for climate action.  Earth observation resources form the basis for predictive modeling, allowing communities and businesses to plan sustainably, improving their resilience to climate change. The continuous evolution of data management systems affords great opportunities to the enhancement of knowledge and advancement of Earth science research.
## Problems
As the climate of earth is changing more than the prediction, there is a great danger ahead of humankind. Temperature of mother earth is rising as a result the sea level is also rising. Heat pollution of water is also a consequence of rising of temperature. Freshwater sources are decreasing so people may face scarcity of drinking water. Greater amount of Ultraviolet ray is incoming to earth as a result of destruction of ozone layer. From 30 years of satellite data, the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching Earth's surface has increased markedly over the last three decades. Soil is getting polluted by excess chemical use and heavy industrialization and moisture of soil is decreasing day by day. Soils are also the largest active store of carbon, after the oceans, and therefore crucial in fighting the climate crisis. Soils provide 95% of all food but are damaged by industrial, farming, mining and urban pollution. Landslide is becoming a concern nowadays. Every year, landslides – the movement of rock, soil, and debris down a slope – cause thousands of deaths, billions of dollars in damages, and disruptions to roads and power lines. As permafrost melts, rocky slopes can become more unstable resulting in a landslide.  Many cyclones and storms also occurring frequently than ever as airspeed is changing due to rise of temperature. Air is getting polluted due to industrialization and harmful gas emission by automobiles such as Carbon Monoxide, Sulphur Dioxide and oxides of Nitrogen. Air pollution is one of the world’s largest health and environmental problems. It develops in two contexts: indoor (household) air pollution and outdoor air pollution.
## Analysis by Atlas Data Box
###	Sea Level rising & Temperature rising
One of the most important effects of global warming is melting ice caps. In such instance, after using our ground stations' sensors for recording the increase in sea level brought on by ice melting, we will gather the relevant information and use IOT to upload it to our server as well as our application. We have a number of ground stations set up all across the planet. These stations will collect local temperature information, allowing us to integrate it into our server and IOT app. As a result, we will receive accurate information about whether global warming is causing temperatures to rise or fall.
###	UV Ray 
With the use of IR proximity sensors in our ground stations, we are able to track the daily rise in UV radiation radioactivity. Additionally, it will describe the state of the ozone layer in the area that the stations are now monitoring. Furthermore, the data will be restored in our server and app using IOT solution. 
###	Water Quality 
Our ground stations can measure the quality of water. Ground stations will contain a testing tube which contains several sensors which will measure the amount of different components in water such as pH, chemicals etc. On time updates will be given through stations. Through this process unpolluted freshwater reservoir can be found and we can be acknowledged about water pollution and the reason behind the pollution. 
###	Soil Moisture 
Soil sensors are used to link the ground stations. It will be able to determine the fertility of the soil. It will identify suitable plantings, soil fertilizations, land manipulation, etc. in that region, all of which are crucial for the fertility of the soil. 
###	Landslide
We installed a gyroscope in the ground stations to detect probable landslides and land cracks and to notify the people as well as to update our server and app. 
###	Wind Speed
Ground stations will detect wind speed. Wind speed helps us to predict weather conditions such as storms, rain etc. So ground stations can be used as anemometer.
###	Air Quality
Using ground stations, we can identify the elements that contribute to air pollution by detecting airborne particles such nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, argon, and carbon dioxide.

Here we can see data provided by NASA shows how freshwater source is decreasing.

The slider above shows satellite data of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from the Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) data for two years, 2005 (left) and 2016 (right). The data indicate that levels of this pollutant changed significantly over the last decade in many places around the world.  Slide the bar from back and forth to see these changes. More information on NO2 trends for each region and more than 300 world cities can be found under the Nitrogen Dioxide tab.

Here is the data provided by NASA showing icreasing Temp. of Earth.

Sea level has been rising over the past century partly due to thermal expansion of ocean as it warms, and partly due to melting of glaciers and ice caps.
